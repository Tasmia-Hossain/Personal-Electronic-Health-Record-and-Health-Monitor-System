# Personal-Electronic-Health-Record-and-Health-Monitor-System
This is a Java project for Semester 2.1

SD Lab II

2nd Year 1st Semester

The Personal Electronic Health Record and Health Monitor System is a Java Swing based desktop application developed using Java Programming Language and MySQL
RDBMS program for efficient management of personal health information. This user-centric app aims to empower individuals in effectively organizing and accessing 
their health records for better self-care.
The app allows users to create, update, and maintain their electronic health records, 
including important details such as medical history, diagnoses, treatments, medications, 
allergies, immunizations, and lab results. With an intuitive user interface, users can 
easily navigate through the app and manage their health information conveniently.
The app provides features for users to manually input and track their health metrics. 
Users can record vital statistics such as blood pressure, heart rate, glucose levels, sleep 
patterns, and other relevant health indicators within the app. This functionality helps 
individuals monitor their well-being and gain insights into their health trends.
As a Java Swing application, the focus of security is on providing basic measures to 
protect user data. The use of MySQL as the database management system ensures data 
persistence and retrieval. However, additional security measures are considered for 
data protection, such as implementing secure login mechanism sensitive information.
The Personal Electronic Health Record and Health Monitor System is designed to offer 
individuals a convenient platform for managing their personal health records and 
tracking their health metrics. By utilizing Java Swing and MySQL the app provides an 
accessible and user-friendly solution for individuals to take control of their health 
information and support their personal health management goals.
